# Crypto Orderbook 

A combined orderbook API sourcing from `bittrex` and `poloniex`. Built with express, ramda, sanctuary, typescript, jest, nock, and more.

# NOTES:

- It would seem that [coinapi.io](https://docs.coinapi.io/#order-book) would be pretty useful for this sort of thing, but it didn't seem like that was the spirit of the task.

# TODO:

- Document routes
- Deploy somewhere
- `TODO` in `tsconfig` about module imports
- Remove *all* // @ts-ignore
- More tests
